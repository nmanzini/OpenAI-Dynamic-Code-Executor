# LLM code generator and executor

This project is a Python-based code generator that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate code snippets based on user requests. The Agent can write, store, retrieve, and execute code definitions. The code definitions are generated by the AI and can be retrieved and executed.

It is a really simple and not reviewed code written on a flight after the agi house hackaton on march 2024.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
The main entry point of the application is main.py. It sets up an OpenAI agent with a set of tools for storing, retrieving, and executing code definitions.

A code definition is a named piece of code with a description, inputs, and outputs. Code definitions are generated by the AI and can be retrieved and executed.

Here is an example of how to retrieve and execute a code definition:
```python
from store import getCodeDefinition, executeCodeDefinition

# Retrieve a code definition
code_def = getCodeDefinition(name="add")

# Execute the code definition
result = executeCodeDefinition(code_def, inputs={"a": 1, "b": 2})

print(result)  # Outputs: {'sum': 3}
```

# Lama index
This project is using llama index to use the various LLMs.
